#### Interests:
1. History, especially regarding warfare and World War 2
2. Modding and playing games. I hope to make a game someday. modding games gave me a good initial idea of 
programming conventions, different language's syntax, and how software is organized. My favorite game is probably Doom (1993)
3. Science and science fiction. I love Star Trek, Next Genration or Deep Space Nuine are my favorite series.



## Technical Background

I've used computers since I was a child, when my mom installed games like Pajama Sam and Freddie Fish for me.
I loved puzzle games, and I have to imagine that early introduction to logical thinking and computers my mom gave me
helped contribute to my choice in pursuing software development.

Ever since then I regulary used computers in my personal life and for school. Playing PC games, looking on 
forums to solve issues, and dabbling with modifying game files, gave me a basic overview of how computer hardware 
and software functions.

What's also helped is my interest in math. I find subjects like discrete math and linear algebra engaging.

For formal training, I had IT training and worked at an IT helpd desk for a little over a year. After that I started 
taking programming courses at GRCC, eventually transferring to GVSU to pursue a degree in computer science. currently I'm 
a little over half-way towards my bachelor's.

Fairly competent with Python, Java, and shells.
